Adds basic [viewport meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag) to your meteor project.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Why? So your website looks nice on mobiles too.

## To install

```bash
    $ meteor add superandrew:viewport
```

That's all.
